This is an appendix section. In here we will add some random graphics and explanations
that basically nobody cares but you are proud of them.

```{r appendix-plot}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


trees %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Girth, y = Volume)) +
  geom_point()
```

that's it. This was how to appendix 101
